message = """Dear You,

I’ve reached the end of my rope, and I can’t keep pretending that everything is okay. Every morning feels like waking up to the same cold, empty void; every night, I’m swallowed by darkness I can’t escape. I’ve tried to find meaning in this endless cycle, but there’s nothing left for me here.

Please don’t mourn me or write me into some tragic hero’s story. I owe you no apologies, and I leave no debts—emotional or otherwise. I’m not seeking pity or forgiveness. My decision is mine alone, and I take full responsibility.

Don’t scour my belongings for clues or replay our last conversation until you’re broken. I want you to move forward without me. Life goes on; people heal. I hope, one day, you’ll smile without feeling guilty that I am no longer around.

This isn’t about you. It’s about the unbearable weight I’ve carried for far too long. I’m simply letting go.

Maybe i can share more codes too, but if i stop sharing codes and videos on tiktok, think me death.

If you're out there, you can contact me somehow, but im not sure i can speak, or even an message request is enough, if i cant accept, think me as death.

Goodbye, and take care of yourselves.

— A Lost Soul"""
